# Working with the Stability cluster

We currently run our large scale experiments on the Stability AI HPC cluster.
This subdirectory features a few helpful scripts that can help you get up and
running on the cluster.

1. [Install Miniconda](linux-cluster/miniconda_install.sh) -
   installs miniconda for your cluster environment.

2. [Create Environment](linux-cluster/env_creation.sh) -
   creates a basic conda environment with the requirements to run experiments.
